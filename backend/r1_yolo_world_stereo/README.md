# Web integration and Jetson GPU setup

The Object Distance tab uses `backend/robot_stereo_detection.py`, with REST
start/stop/class controls, WebSocket status, and two MJPEG monitors. The copied
calibration, YOLO-World weights and cached CLIP weights are resolved relative
to this directory. Confirm that the calibration belongs to your camera pair.

YOLO defaults to `R1_YOLO_DEVICE=cuda:0`; the model and prompt preparation are
moved to that device. Missing CUDA produces a visible error, with no automatic
CPU fallback. `R1_YOLO_DEVICE=cpu` explicitly enables CPU development. Stereo
rectification and SGBM depth still run on CPU. Defaults are 416-pixel YOLO input,
detection every two frames, and 64 stereo disparities. GPU name is shown in
the page metrics after initialization.

Install CUDA-enabled PyTorch and matching torchvision for the actual JetPack
and Python version before installing Ultralytics. Preserve that torch build
and the system OpenCV/GStreamer installation when resolving dependencies.
The existing FastAPI application requires Python 3.10 or newer; stock legacy
Nano Python environments cannot run it unchanged. Original Nano and Orin Nano
need different software stacks. This port has not been benchmarked on either.

Use the official compatibility instructions:
- https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/install-pytorch-jetson-platform/index.html
- https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/nvidia-jetson/

In the backend environment, verify imports and GPU execution first:

```bash
python3 -c "import torch, torchvision, cv2; from ultralytics import YOLOWorld; assert torch.cuda.is_available(); print(torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)); print(torch.ones(1, device='cuda:0'))"
R1_YOLO_DEVICE=cuda:0 python3 -m backend
```

The inference environment needs numpy, OpenCV, ultralytics (including its CLIP
text encoder dependencies), torch, torchvision, and GStreamer H.264 decoding.
The heavyweight inference imports are deferred until Start detection, so a
missing inference dependency does not prevent robot control from starting.
The local CLIP cache (`weights/clip/ViT-B-32.pt`) is excluded from Git.
On a fresh checkout, provision it from your existing deployment or let the
text encoder download it on first use before going offline. Python CLIP
support must also already be installed. Verify the first start while online
before an offline deployment.

Configure R1 to send stereo UDP to the Jetson's robot-facing IP, then enable
the stereo push service using System Services. Stop the ordinary video viewer
before starting Object Distance; both consume UDP 5003 and the API rejects
concurrent starts. Start detection, verify the GPU name and live FPS, then
apply comma-separated English object prompts. Applying prompts restarts the
pipeline. Use `R1_YOLO_IMAGE_SIZE=320` or increase `R1_YOLO_DETECT_EVERY` if needed
and measure actual performance; no real-time frame rate is guaranteed.

# R1 YOLO-World stereo distance

This pipeline runs entirely on the PC receiving the R1 left/right RTP streams:

```text
UDP 5002/5003 -> rectify -> StereoSGBM -> metric 3D -> YOLO-World -> distance
```

## Starting the stereo service

Unitree officially documents starting Stereo Patch PC1 manually in the app.
The generic `robot_state` DDS API may expose it to the PC, depending on the R1
firmware. `r1_service_control.py` is an experimental wrapper around that DDS
API; it does not modify startup files on PC1 and does not guess service names.

> **Important:** The R1 stereo video is sent over UDP to the configured target
> IP only. This setup targets `192.168.123.164`, so the network interface
> connected to the robot must be configured with that exact IP address. If the
> PC uses a different address, no video packets will arrive on UDP ports 5002
> and 5003 even when `stereo_patch_pc1` is running.

First identify the network interface connected to R1:

```bash
ip -br address
```

For example, this PC currently shows:

```text
enx00051b901cbf  UP  192.168.123.164/24
```

Run the tool from its directory. The `list` action is read-only:

```bash
cd /home/r1-edu/unitree_sdk2_python/my_script/r1_yolo_world_stereo
/usr/bin/python3 r1_service_control.py enx00051b901cbf list
```

Expected table format:

```text
SERVICE                                    STATUS   PROTECTED
some_service                               0        no
another_service                            1        yes
```

Tested on this R1 on 2026-08-18: the robot returned the following exact,
unprotected entry:

```text
stereo_patch_pc1                           0        no
```

Unitree does not document `ServiceList.status` as an on/off Boolean, so do not
interpret `0` by itself as stopped or started. Verify the resulting UDP stream.
For this robot, the concrete start command is:

```bash
/usr/bin/python3 r1_service_control.py \
  enx00051b901cbf on stereo_patch_pc1
```

Search the returned list for likely stereo/video services, but do not use a
guessed name:

```bash
/usr/bin/python3 r1_service_control.py enx00051b901cbf list \
  | grep -Ei 'stereo|video|push'
```

If the full list contains an unprotected stereo/push service, copy its exact
case-sensitive name and switch it on:

```bash
/usr/bin/python3 r1_service_control.py \
  enx00051b901cbf on '<exact-service-name>'
```

Verify success from the video packets rather than relying only on the numeric
service status:

```bash
sudo tcpdump -ni enx00051b901cbf -c 20 \
  'udp port 5001 or udp port 5002 or udp port 5003'
```

Stop the same service when finished:

```bash
/usr/bin/python3 r1_service_control.py \
  enx00051b901cbf off stereo_patch_pc1
```

Possible outcomes:

- `ServiceList failed` or timeout: wrong interface, DDS cannot reach R1, or the
  R1 `robot_state` service is unavailable.
- Service not returned: PC1 does not expose it through this API.
- `PROTECTED=yes`: firmware explicitly prevents remote switching.
- Switch succeeds but no UDP arrives: R1 Push Service or its target IP still
  needs configuration; Stereo Patch PC1 alone may not complete the data path.

If the service is absent or protected, this firmware cannot switch it through
the public `robot_state` API. Use Unitree App -> Settings -> Service Status, or
request an official PC1 control API from Unitree. Unitree also warns that
`video_hub` may conflict with the stereo push service, so do not try to run both
camera paths simultaneously.

## Requirements

Confirm both streams reach the PC:

```bash
sudo tcpdump -ni any 'udp port 5002 or udp port 5003'
```

The programs automatically use OpenCV's GStreamer backend when available. On
systems where OpenCV reports `GStreamer: NO`, they run `gst-launch-1.0` as a
decoder and read its raw BGR output, so rebuilding OpenCV is unnecessary. Force
this fallback when diagnosing capture with `--capture-backend gstreamer-cli`.

Install YOLO-World support in the same Python environment. Do not replace a
working GStreamer-enabled OpenCV build with a PyPI OpenCV wheel:

```bash
/usr/bin/python3 -m pip install --user ultralytics
```

YOLO-World weights and its text encoder may be downloaded on first use. For an
offline PC, download/cache them in advance.

## Metric stereo calibration

Print a flat chessboard and accurately measure one square in metres. The
`--columns` and `--rows` values are counts of *inner corners*, not squares.
For example, for a 10 by 7 square board, use 9 by 6 inner corners:

```bash
cd /home/r1-edu/unitree_sdk2_python/my_script/r1_yolo_world_stereo
/usr/bin/python3 r1_stereo_calibrate.py \
  --columns 9 \
  --rows 6 \
  --square-size-m 0.024 \
  --output r1_stereo_calibration.npz
```

Show the chessboard in both cameras. Press Space to capture at least 20 varied
pairs: near/far, tilted, and across the centre and all image corners. Press `c`
to solve. Recalibrate if stereo RMS is above roughly 1 pixel. Never invent the
square size: its scale determines the reported distance and baseline.

If Unitree supplies factory `K1`, `D1`, `K2`, `D2`, `R`, and `T`, those are
preferable. Store `T` in metres and use the same NPZ keys generated above.

## Run detection and distance

```bash
cd /home/r1-edu/unitree_sdk2_python/my_script/r1_yolo_world_stereo
/usr/bin/python3 r1_yolo_world_stereo_distance.py \
  --calibration r1_stereo_calibration.npz \
  --classes 'person,chair,bottle,cup,box,door' \
  --model yolov8s-worldv2.pt
```

For a CPU-only PC, start with the faster profile below. YOLO runs every second
frame while stereo distance still updates on every frame:

```bash
python r1_yolo_world_stereo_distance.py \
  --calibration r1_stereo_calibration.npz \
  --classes 'person,chair,bottle,cup,box,door' \
  --model yolov8s-worldv2.pt \
  --device cpu \
  --image-size 416 \
  --num-disparities 64 \
  --block-size 3 \
  --detect-every 2
```

Use English noun prompts for the default YOLO-World text encoder. The default
distance is optical-axis `Z`; pass `--distance-mode euclidean` for straight-line
camera-to-object distance.

Important limitations:

- OpenCV pairs frames by decoder arrival time because it does not expose RTP
  timestamps through `VideoCapture`. Keep `pair delta` small and test first on
  stationary objects. A production moving-scene system should pair native RTP
  timestamps through GStreamer.
- Stereo depth can fail on shiny, transparent, textureless, occluded, or very
  distant surfaces. `no depth` is safer than displaying an unsupported value.
- The central 40 percent of each detection is sampled and trimmed before taking
  a median to reduce foreground/background mixing.
- This is a perception estimate, not a safety-rated distance measurement.
