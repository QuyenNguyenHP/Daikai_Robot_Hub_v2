# Daikai Robot Hub: Control the Unitree R1 Robot with Face Recognition

Daikai Robot Hub is a local robot operations and face-recognition application
built with FastAPI, React, OpenCV YuNet, and OpenCV SFace. It combines:

- Unitree R1 camera access through Unitree SDK2
- face enrollment and recognition
- robot speech playback
- robot battery monitoring
- bounded locomotion control

The application uses one camera source:

- **Unitree R1 camera**: the robot camera, read by the backend through
  Unitree SDK2.

The robot camera shares the same YuNet, SFace, and face database stored in
`data/`. The main interface also lets you:

- send English speech to the robot speaker
- view live battery telemetry
- send safe movement commands
- enable automatic spoken name greetings when recognition confidence reaches
  55% or higher

For a fresh installation, follow the [Simple Setup Guide](SETUP.md).

## YOLO-World stereo deployment

The Object Distance page uses three files from the stereo reference folder:

| File                          | Purpose                                            | Current location                                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `yolov8s-worldv2.pt`        | YOLO-World object detector                         | `backend/models/yolov8s-worldv2.pt`                                                         |
| `weights/clip/ViT-B-32.pt`  | Text encoder used by`set_classes()`              | `/home/r1-edu/unitree_sdk2_python/my_script/r1_yolo_world_stereo/weights/clip/ViT-B-32.pt`  |
| `r1_stereo_calibration.npz` | R1 stereo intrinsics, extrinsics, and metric scale | `/home/r1-edu/unitree_sdk2_python/my_script/r1_yolo_world_stereo/r1_stereo_calibration.npz` |

The current PC already has all three files. The YOLO model is approximately
25 MB, the CLIP encoder is approximately 338 MB, and the calibration is small.
No model download is required on this PC.

### Prepare a new PC

Install the project dependencies first:

```bash
cd /path/to/r1_robot_development
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

cd frontend
npm install
```

If the backend reports `No module named 'ultralytics'`, install Ultralytics
with the same Python interpreter used to launch the backend:

```bash
python3 -m pip install "ultralytics>=8.3.0"
python3 -c "import ultralytics; print(ultralytics.__version__)"
```

Create a directory for the stereo assets. It must also contain
`r1_stereo_common.py` from the reference implementation:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/r1_yolo_world_stereo"
cp /path/to/r1_stereo_common.py "$HOME/r1_yolo_world_stereo/"
cd "$HOME/r1_yolo_world_stereo"
```

With internet access, the official Ultralytics Python API downloads
`yolov8s-worldv2.pt` when the named pretrained model is first loaded. Download
it directly into the project's backend model directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/r1_robot_development/backend/models

python3 - <<'PY'
from ultralytics import YOLOWorld

model = YOLOWorld("yolov8s-worldv2.pt")
print("YOLO-World model is ready")
PY
```

YOLO-World also requires the CLIP encoder when setting open-vocabulary class
prompts. Run this from the stereo asset directory so the encoder is downloaded
to `weights/clip/`, where the backend expects it:

```bash
cd "$HOME/r1_yolo_world_stereo"

python3 - <<'PY'
from ultralytics import YOLOWorld

model = YOLOWorld("/path/to/r1_robot_development/backend/models/yolov8s-worldv2.pt")
model.set_classes(["person", "chair", "bottle", "cup", "table", "door", "box"])
print("CLIP encoder is ready")
PY
```

After both commands finish, verify the files:

```bash
ls -lh \
  "/path/to/r1_robot_development/backend/models/yolov8s-worldv2.pt" \
  "$HOME/r1_yolo_world_stereo/weights/clip/ViT-B-32.pt"
```

The stereo calibration cannot be replaced by a generic download. It contains
measurements for the particular R1 stereo cameras and determines the scale of
the reported distance. Copy the tested calibration from the current PC:

```bash
scp r1-edu@CURRENT_PC_IP:/home/r1-edu/unitree_sdk2_python/my_script/r1_yolo_world_stereo/r1_stereo_calibration.npz \
  "$HOME/r1_yolo_world_stereo/"
```

Alternatively, copy the project and the entire tested reference directory to
the new PC; this avoids downloading the YOLO and CLIP files again:

```bash
rsync -av \
  r1-edu@CURRENT_PC_IP:/home/r1-edu/unitree_sdk2_python/my_script/r1_yolo_world_stereo/ \
  "$HOME/r1_yolo_world_stereo/"
```

### Start the application on the new PC

Point the backend at the new asset directory before starting it. Replace
`ROBOT_INTERFACE` with the Ethernet interface connected to the R1, such as
`enx00051b901cbf`:

```bash
cd /path/to/r1_robot_development

export R1_STEREO_SOURCE_DIR="$HOME/r1_yolo_world_stereo"
export R1_STEREO_CALIBRATION="$R1_STEREO_SOURCE_DIR/r1_stereo_calibration.npz"

python3 backend ROBOT_INTERFACE --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The backend automatically loads `backend/models/yolov8s-worldv2.pt`. Set
`R1_YOLO_WORLD_MODEL` only when storing that file somewhere else.

In another terminal:

```bash
cd /path/to/r1_robot_development/frontend
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`, enable the robot's stereo push service from the
System Services page, open Object Distance, and select **Start detection**.
Both UDP streams on ports 5002 and 5003 must reach the new PC.

The model-loading and custom-class API used here follows the official
[Ultralytics YOLO-World documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo-world/).

## General frontend style

The frontend uses a dark, futuristic operations-dashboard style. The visual
language is restrained rather than decorative: deep navy backgrounds, layered
translucent panels, fine low-contrast borders, compact telemetry labels, and a
bright cyan accent for interactive and live states. The complete implementation
is in [`frontend/src/styles.css`](frontend/src/styles.css).

### Design foundation

- **Typography:** use **DM Sans** for body text, controls, and labels. Use
  **Manrope** at weights 500-700 for headings, metrics, and other prominent
  values. Headings use slightly tight letter spacing; small labels use wide
  letter spacing and often uppercase text.
- **Page background:** start with `#07101c` and add subtle blue/cyan radial
  gradients. This creates depth without competing with application content.
- **Surfaces:** use dark navy translucent gradients, a `20px` radius, a faint
  cool-gray border, and a soft downward shadow. Nested surfaces are darker,
  flatter, and normally use an `8-12px` radius.
- **Accent color:** cyan communicates primary actions, focus, connectivity,
  active navigation, recognition, and live data. Do not use it on every piece
  of text; the limited use of cyan preserves its meaning.
- **Semantic color:** coral red communicates errors, unknown detections, stop
  actions, and safety warnings. Soft green is reserved for successful results
  or healthy states.
- **Text hierarchy:** use near-white for important content, blue-gray for
  supporting text, and small uppercase cyan text for section eyebrows.

Core colors can be copied into another project as CSS custom properties:

```css
:root {
  font-family: 'DM Sans', system-ui, sans-serif;
  color: #e7edf7;
  background: #07101c;

  --bg: #07101c;
  --panel: rgba(15, 28, 44, 0.82);
  --panel-border: rgba(148, 171, 202, 0.14);
  --muted: #8ea0b9;
  --cyan: #55dfd2;
  --cyan-deep: #0da99c;
  --danger: #ff6f7d;
}
```

The main surface treatment is:

```css
.panel {
  background: linear-gradient(
    145deg,
    rgba(17, 32, 50, 0.95),
    rgba(11, 23, 38, 0.9)
  );
  border: 1px solid var(--panel-border);
  border-radius: 20px;
  box-shadow: 0 22px 60px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.18);
}
```

### Layout and spacing

Content is centered in a `1440px` maximum-width container with fluid horizontal
padding (`clamp(18px, 4vw, 64px)`). Desktop pages use CSS Grid for a wide main
workspace and a narrower status/control column. Keep `20px` between major
panels and approximately `20-24px` of internal panel padding. Use Flexbox for
small one-dimensional groups such as headings, actions, status rows, and
navigation.

The top bar is sticky and slightly translucent with an `18px` backdrop blur.
This glass effect should be limited to persistent navigation and modal
backdrops; normal content stays readable through more opaque panel surfaces.

### Reusable component conventions

- **Buttons:** `42px` minimum height, `10px` radius, bold `13px` text, and a
  subtle `0.2s` transition. Primary buttons use cyan with very dark text;
  secondary buttons use a faint gray-blue fill and border. Disabled controls
  reduce opacity and replace the pointer cursor.
- **Inputs:** `46px` height, `10px` radius, dark translucent fill, and a subtle
  border. Focus changes the border to deep cyan and adds a low-opacity cyan
  focus ring.
- **Status pills:** use fully rounded capsules, compact `11px` text, a faint
  background, and a small circular indicator. A live indicator becomes cyan
  and receives a restrained glow.
- **Telemetry:** show important numbers in Manrope and supporting labels in
  small, widely spaced DM Sans. Definition lists and compact two-column grids
  work well for dense metrics.
- **Feedback:** display errors in coral, successes in soft green, and keep both
  on low-opacity tinted backgrounds with matching borders.
- **Motion:** keep animation functional and short. The current interface uses
  small hover lifts, color fades, status glows, and linear tracking-box
  movement rather than large decorative animation.

### Responsive behavior

The design uses two breakpoints:

- At `900px` and below, major two-column workspaces become one column. Supporting
  side panels may remain in two columns when space permits, and secondary API
  status is hidden.
- At `620px` and below, the header and all supporting panels become one column,
  navigation stretches across the width, panel padding reduces to `15px`, and
  action/form rows stack or become equal-width grids.

When reusing this style, preserve the hierarchy of **page background -> panel ->
nested surface**, the restrained cyan accent, and the `20px` spacing rhythm.
Application-specific selectors such as camera, battery, face-box, and movement
controls can be omitted; the root tokens, `.panel`, `.button`, `.text-input`,
status, feedback, layout, and responsive rules form the reusable core.

## Architecture

```text
Unitree R1 camera  -> Unitree SDK2 -> RobotCamera ------+
                                                        +-> FastAPI -> YuNet -> SFace
Unitree R1 battery -> DDS topic -> RobotBattery -------+
Unitree R1 motion  -> RobotControl API ----------------+
Unitree R1 speaker -> RobotSpeech API -----------------+
```

The robot camera, battery, motion, and speaker integrations are handled by the
backend because the browser does not connect to Unitree DDS directly.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 when using Unitree SDK2 Python.
- Node.js 20 or newer, with Node.js 22 recommended.
- npm 10 or newer.
- Unitree SDK2 Python and a network interface connected to the robot when using
  robot mode.
- `pico2wave` as the preferred TTS engine, with `espeak` fallback, plus
  `ffmpeg` or `sox` when using robot speech.

## Installation

If the machine does not have `python3.10` yet, for example on Debian Trixie or
Raspberry Pi OS, install Python 3.10 first using step 1 in
**Install Unitree SDK2 Python** below before continuing.

### Install Node.js and npm if needed

Check whether Node.js and npm are already installed:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

If one of them is missing, install Node.js 22 using `nvm`. This works on both
Debian and Ubuntu, and npm is installed together with Node.js:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y curl

curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.4/install.sh | bash

export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"

command -v nvm
nvm install 22
nvm alias default 22

node --version
npm --version
```

`command -v nvm` should print `nvm`. If it says `nvm: command not found`, close
the terminal, open a new one, and run the checks again.

### Install backend and frontend dependencies

```bash
python3.10 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

If the two models in `backend/models/` are missing:

```bash
python -m backend.download_models
```

### Install `pico2wave` for robot speech

Robot speech prefers `pico2wave`. If it is not installed yet, install it on
Debian, Ubuntu, or Raspberry Pi OS with:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y libttspico-utils
```

Check that the command is available:

```bash
which pico2wave
pico2wave --help
```

To let the backend convert audio for robot playback, also install one of:

```bash
sudo apt install -y ffmpeg
```

or:

```bash
sudo apt install -y sox
```

Quick `pico2wave` test:

```bash
pico2wave -l=en-US -w /tmp/pico-test.wav "Hello from Daikai Robot Hub"
ls -lh /tmp/pico-test.wav
```

If the WAV file is created successfully, text-to-speech is ready for backend
use.

## Run the frontend locally

Terminal 1:

```bash
python backend/app.py
```

Terminal 2:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`, choose **Unitree R1 camera**, then click
**Start camera**.

## Install Unitree SDK2 Python

> **Requirement:** use **Python 3.10**. Check the version before installing:
>
> ```bash
> python3.10 --version
> ```

### 1. Install Python 3.10 and system packages

Check the operating system:

```bash
cat /etc/os-release
```

Choose **one** of the following installation paths.

#### Option A - Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

Ubuntu 22.04 already provides Python 3.10 in the repository. Install it with
`apt`:

```bash
cd ~

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
    python3.10 \
    python3.10-venv \
    python3.10-dev \
    python3-pip \
    git \
    cmake \
    build-essential

python3.10 --version
```

If Ubuntu reports `Unable to locate package python3.10`, do not add Debian
repositories to Ubuntu. Use **Option B** and build Python 3.10 from source.

#### Option B - Debian Trixie, Raspberry Pi OS, or Ubuntu without Python 3.10

Debian Trixie uses Python 3.13 by default and does not include
`python3.10`, `python3.10-venv`, or `python3.10-dev` in the default
repository. Install the build dependencies and build a separate Python 3.10
from source. `make altinstall` does not overwrite the system `python3`.

```bash
cd ~

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
    git \
    cmake \
    build-essential \
    wget \
    xz-utils \
    libssl-dev \
    zlib1g-dev \
    libbz2-dev \
    libreadline-dev \
    libsqlite3-dev \
    libncurses-dev \
    libgdbm-dev \
    liblzma-dev \
    libffi-dev \
    libexpat1-dev \
    uuid-dev

cd ~
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.20/Python-3.10.20.tar.xz
echo "de6517421601e39a9a3bc3e1bc4c7b2f239297423ee05e282598c83ec0647505  Python-3.10.20.tar.xz" \
    | sha256sum --check

tar -xf Python-3.10.20.tar.xz
cd Python-3.10.20
./configure --with-ensurepip=install
make -j"$(nproc)"
sudo make altinstall

python3.10 --version
```

The expected result is `Python 3.10.20`. Do not change the system `python3`
symlink to Python 3.10.

### 2. Build Cyclone DDS

```bash
cd ~

git clone \
    --branch releases/0.10.x \
    https://github.com/eclipse-cyclonedds/cyclonedds.git

cd ~/cyclonedds
mkdir -p build install
cd build

cmake .. \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/cyclonedds/install"

cmake --build . --target install -j"$(nproc)"
```

### 3. Download Unitree SDK2 Python

```bash
cd ~

git clone \
    https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_sdk2_python.git

cd ~/unitree_sdk2_python
```

### 4. Create and activate the Python 3.10 virtual environment

Create `.venv` directly inside the Unitree SDK2 Python project:

```bash
python3.10 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

The virtual environment is created at:

```text
~/unitree_sdk2_python/.venv
```

After activation, the terminal should look similar to:

```text
(.venv) user@computer:~/unitree_sdk2_python$
```

Confirm that `.venv` uses Python 3.10, then upgrade the install tools:

```bash
python --version
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

### 5. Export Cyclone DDS paths

Run these commands in the terminal where `.venv` is active:

```bash
export CYCLONEDDS_HOME="$HOME/cyclonedds/install"
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$CYCLONEDDS_HOME:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$CYCLONEDDS_HOME/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
```

### 6. Install Unitree SDK2 Python

From `~/unitree_sdk2_python`, run:

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```

Check that the SDK was installed successfully:

```bash
python -c "from unitree_sdk2py.go2.video.video_client import VideoClient; print('Unitree SDK2 Python OK')"
```

To run the robot camera, the Daikai Robot Hub backend and Unitree SDK2 must live in the
same Python environment. While the Unitree `.venv` is still active, install the
Daikai Robot Hub dependencies as well:

```bash
cd /home/r1-edu/Documents/Facial-Reconigtion
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Every time you open a new terminal, activate `.venv` again and export the
Cyclone DDS environment variables before starting the app.

## Run with the Unitree R1 camera

Find the network interface connected to the robot:

```bash
ip link
```

Activate the environment where Unitree SDK2 was installed, export Cyclone DDS
and the network interface, then start the backend:

```bash
source ~/unitree_sdk2_python/.venv/bin/activate

export CYCLONEDDS_HOME="$HOME/cyclonedds/install"
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$CYCLONEDDS_HOME:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$CYCLONEDDS_HOME/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
export UNITREE_NETWORK_INTERFACE=enx00051b901cbf

python backend/app.py
```

Replace `enxa0cec86d95d6` with the interface name found from `ip link`. Do not
run multiple Uvicorn workers in robot mode because Unitree DDS and the camera
client are shared resources inside one process.

Check the camera:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/robot/status | python3 -m json.tool
```

A successful connection looks like:

```json
{
  "state": "connected",
  "connected": true,
  "frame_sequence": 100,
  "error": null
}
```

Then choose **Unitree R1 camera** in the UI and click **Start camera**.

## Robot API

The backend provides these endpoints:

| Endpoint                                     | Purpose                                       |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /api/robot/status`                    | View robot camera configuration and state     |
| `POST /api/robot/connect`                  | Start the shared Unitree camera client        |
| `GET /api/robot/snapshot`                  | Get the newest robot JPEG                     |
| `GET /api/robot/stream`                    | View the live MJPEG stream                    |
| `POST /api/robot/recognize?threshold=0.45` | Recognize faces in the newest frame           |
| `GET /api/robot/battery`                   | View the latest battery telemetry             |
| `GET /api/robot/control/status`            | View locomotion control status                |
| `GET /api/robot/mode`                      | Query the current robot FSM mode              |
| `POST /api/robot/control`                  | Send a bounded locomotion command             |
| `GET /api/robot/speech/status`             | Check speech tool availability and busy state |
| `POST /api/robot/speak`                    | Send English speech to the robot speaker      |

The HTTP API can also be used by external clients if needed.

For backend implementation details, endpoint behavior, and recommended launch
modes, see [`backend/README.md`](backend/README.md).

## Face enrollment

1. Open the **Enroll** screen.
2. Enter the person's name.
3. Use the Unitree R1 camera to capture samples.
4. Capture 10-20 clear images with slight pose and expression changes.
5. Click **Create face profile**.

Images and vectors are stored in:

```text
data/faces/<name>/
data/embeddings.npz
data/metadata.json
```

## Recognition

1. Open the **Recognize** screen.
2. Use the Unitree R1 camera.
3. Click **Start camera**.
4. Click **Start recognition**.

The default threshold is `0.45`. Raise it to reduce false positives, or lower
it if the system struggles to recognize already enrolled people.

## Khởi động với Wi-Fi `wlp2s0` và robot Ethernet `eth10`

Hướng dẫn này dùng khi máy chạy Daikai Robot Hub có địa chỉ
`192.168.0.75` trên `wlp2s0`, các thiết bị khác trong cùng mạng cần truy cập
frontend, và robot được kết nối riêng qua `eth10`.

### Terminal backend

Từ thư mục gốc của dự án, cấu hình CORS cho frontend trong mạng LAN và cho
FastAPI lắng nghe trên tất cả địa chỉ mạng:

```bash
cd /home/unitree/Daikai_Robot_Hub_v2

export FR_CORS_ORIGINS=http://192.168.0.75:5173,http://localhost:5173,http://127.0.0.1:5173

python3 -m backend eth10 --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Tham số `eth10` cấu hình network interface kết nối robot cho Unitree SDK.
`--host 0.0.0.0` cho FastAPI lắng nghe trên cả `eth10`, `wlp2s0` và loopback,
do đó các thiết bị trong Wi-Fi vẫn truy cập backend qua `192.168.0.75:8000`.
Hãy chạy lệnh bằng Python environment đã cài `unitree_sdk2py`.

### Terminal frontend

Frontend phải gọi IP của máy backend thay vì `localhost`, vì trên điện thoại
hoặc laptop khác, `localhost` sẽ trỏ về chính thiết bị đang mở trình duyệt.

```bash
cd /home/unitree/Daikai_Robot_Hub_v2/frontend

VITE_API_URL=http://192.168.0.75:8000 npm run dev
```

Sau khi thay đổi `VITE_API_URL`, phải dừng và khởi động lại Vite. Trên thiết bị
khác trong cùng mạng, mở:

```text
http://192.168.0.75:5173
```

Kiểm tra backend trực tiếp tại:

```text
http://192.168.0.75:8000/api/health
http://192.168.0.75:8000/docs
```

Kiểm tra hai dịch vụ đang lắng nghe trên LAN:

```bash
ip -4 addr show wlp2s0
ip -4 addr show eth10
ss -lntp | grep -E ':5173|:8000'
```

Kết quả cần có `0.0.0.0:5173` và `0.0.0.0:8000`. Nếu UFW đang hoạt động,
chỉ mở hai cổng cho subnet nội bộ:

```bash
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/24 to any port 5173 proto tcp
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/24 to any port 8000 proto tcp
```

## Common issues

### `unitree_sdk2py` cannot be imported

Check that you are using the correct Python environment:

```bash
which python
python --version
python -c "from unitree_sdk2py.go2.video.video_client import VideoClient; print('OK')"
```

`which python` should point to `~/unitree_sdk2_python/.venv/bin/python` when
running the robot camera mode.

### Robot state is `not_configured`

Set the environment variable before starting the backend:

```bash
export UNITREE_NETWORK_INTERFACE=enxa0cec86d95d6
```

### Frontend on another machine

Set the backend address before starting Vite:

```bash
export VITE_API_URL=http://BACKEND_IP:8000
```

If needed, open CORS on the backend:

```bash
export FR_CORS_ORIGINS=http://FRONTEND_IP:5173
```

### The robot camera does not start

Check that:

- `UNITREE_NETWORK_INTERFACE` is set correctly;
- the backend is running in the Python environment that contains
  `unitree_sdk2py`;
- the robot is reachable on the selected interface;
- `GET /api/robot/status` reports a configured or connected state.
